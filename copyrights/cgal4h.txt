   an open source license. It is also possible to obtain commercial licenses
   from GeometryFactory (www.geometryfactory.com) for all or parts of CGAL.

   The source code of the CGAL library can be found in the directories
   "src/CGAL", "src/CGALQt", "src/CGALQt5" and "include/CGAL" (with the
   exception of "include/CGAL/CORE", "include/CGAL/OpenNL").
   It is specified in each file of the CGAL library which
   license applies to it. This is either the GNU General Public License
