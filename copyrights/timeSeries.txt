    Version R 2.0.0 claims:
    - The stub packages from 1.9.x have been removed.
    - All the datasets formerly in packages 'base' and 'stats' have
      been moved to a new package 'datasets'. 
    - Package 'graphics' has been split into 'grDevices' (the graphics
      devices shared between base and grid graphics) and 'graphics'
      (base graphics). 
    - Packages must have been re-installed for this version, and
      library() will enforce this.
    - Package names must now be given exactly in library() and
      require(), regardless of whether the underlying file system is
      case-sensitive or not.
