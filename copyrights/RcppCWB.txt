The IMS Corpus Workbench was initially developed by Oliver Christ at the IMS
(University of Stuttgart), with some contributions by Bruno M. Schulze. It has
been maintained since 1998 by Stefan Evert, who is also leading the current
open-source development. CQPweb is the work of Andrew Hardie, inspired by the more
specialised BNCweb interface.
