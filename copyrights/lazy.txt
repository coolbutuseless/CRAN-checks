* The `lazy' package tries to mimic the input/output behavior of
  `loess' as defined in package `modreg' version 1.7.1 which is
  copyrighted by Brian Ripley and the R Core Team and licensed under the
  terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.  

  In particular, the file lazy.R contains R code copied from the
  package `modreg' (although slightly modified).

  Also the manual pages of the package `lazy' were strongly influenced
  by those of `loess'. In particular, the example in `lazy.Rd' is copied
  from the one given in the `loess' man page.
