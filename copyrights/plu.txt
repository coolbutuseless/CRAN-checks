The word list used is a combination of several word list:

1) The ENABLE2K word lists which is in the public domain:

    The ENABLE master word list, WORD.LST, is herewith formally
    released into the Public Domain. Anyone is free to use it or
    distribute it in any manner they see fit. No fee or registration
    is required for its use nor are "contributions" solicited (if you
    feel you absolutely must contribute something for your own peace
    of mind, the authors of the ENABLE list ask that you make a
    donation on their behalf to your favorite charity). This word
    list is our gift to the Scrabble community, as an alternate to
    "official" word lists. Game designers may feel free to
    incorporate the WORD.LST into their games. Please mention the
    source and credit us as originators of the list. Note that if
    you, as a game designer, use the WORD.LST in your product, you
    may still copyright and protect your product, but you may *not*
    legally copyright or in any way restrict redistribution of the
    WORD.LST portion of your product. This *may* under law restrict
    your rights to restrict your users' rights, but that is only
    fair.

2) All of the word lists except ABLE.LST in the ENABLE2K Supplemnt
   which consists of:

     2DICTS.LST  ALSO.LST   LETTERS.LST  OSPDADD.LST  UCACR.LST
     LCACR.LST  NOPOS.LST    PLURALS.LST  UPPER.LST

   All of these word lists are also in the public domain.

3) The list of signature words from the YAWL package which is in the
   public domain.

4) The UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary which in under the following
   copyright:

     Copyright (c) J Ross Beresford 1993-1999. All Rights Reserved.

     The following restriction is placed on the use of this
     publication: if The UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary is used
     in a software package or redistributed in any form, the
     copyright notice must be prominently displayed and the text
     of this document must be included verbatim.

     There are no other restrictions: I would like to see the
     list distributed as widely as possible.

5) Some extra words found in the Part-Of-Speech database that was not
   found in any of the above word lists.

6) Words found in the Jargon File Word List package, available at
   http://aspell.sourceforge.net/wl/, which is in the Public Domain.

7) Words in 2of12id.txt not in any of the word lists above.  2of12id is
   indirectly derived from all the above sources and most of the word
   lists from the Moby Words package:

     10196pla.ces 113809of.fic 21986na.mes 256772co.mpo 354984si.ngl
     3897male.nam 4160offi.cia 4946fema.len 6213acro.nym 74550com.mon

   The Moby Word package, like the Part-Of-Speech database is in the
   public domain.

8) And finally some extra words that I added myself.  These words can be
   found in the file "extra-words"
